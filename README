Taguareit
=========

Introduction
------------

My not so simple "Hello World" Javascript/CSS/HTML only application using [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org/page/index), 
I spent about 4 nights on this before I decided to let [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/g7tbr/taguareit_a_very_simple_multi_player_web_game_i/) lose on it and then it got neglected like any other side line project I work on. So I decided to upload it to github for other people to learn from my mistakes.
 
I used a lot of jQuery plugins and the art work is from [lostgarden](http://www.lostgarden.com/).

How to play
-----------

There is a demo running [here](http://ludo.iriscouch.com/taguareit/_design/taguareit/index.html) thanks to [IrisCouch](http://www.iriscouch.com/) for the hosting.

Get a friend to open up this website as well and let one of you click on "Tag Me". This 
will increase your "Tag Counter"(How many times you have been tagged) and set your name to red. 
Now you can click on the grass to move around and try to touch another player to tag him. 
If you touched another player he will turn red and it's his turn to catch you!

After 30 seconds and no movement a user will go into a idle state and no one will be able to 
tag him or her, until he moves again.

Known Issues
------------

* This is buggy software and I learned a lot. I want to rewrite it when I have time again but for now the issues will stay, except if someone else want to correct them.
* Some antivirus applications will not allow the browser to keep a open connection to the server, 
so strange things may happen.
* I only tested this application with Firefox and Chrome. I know Internet Explorer does not work.
* The application uses your computers time so if it is incorrect, strange things may happen.
* The collision detection happens in the browser so one can easily cheat and I'm sure it is
open for a lot of bugs and hacks.
* Your session will get logged out after 10 minutes.
