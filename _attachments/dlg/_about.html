            <b>How to play</b>
            <p>
                Get a friend to open up this website as well and let one of you click on "Tag Me". This <br/>
                will increase your "Tag Counter"(How many times you have been tagged) and set your name to red. <br/>
                Now you can click on the grass to move around and try to touch another player to tag him. <br/>
                If you touched another player he will turn red and it's his turn to catch you!
            <p>
            <p>
                After 30 seconds and no movement a user will go into a idle state and no one will be able to <br/>
                tag him or her, until he moves again.
            <p>

            <b>Some Background</b>
            <p>
                My not so simple "Hello World" Javascript/CSS/HTML only application using CouchDB and CouchApp, <br/>
                I spent about 4 nights on this before I decided to let reddit lose on it. If you find any <br/>
                mistakes (including spelling and grammar mistakes) please report it on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/g7tbr/taguareit_a_very_simple_multi_player_web_game_i/">reddit</a>. <br/>
                I also used a lot of jQuery plugins and the art work is from  <a href="http://www.lostgarden.com ">lostgarden</a>.

            <b>Known Issues</b>
            <ul>
                <li> Some antivirus applications will not allow the browser to keep a open connection to the server, <br/>
                so strange things may happen.</li>
                <li> I only tested this application with Firefox and Chrome. I know Internet Explorer does not work. </li>
                <li> The application uses your computers time so if it is incorrect, strange things may happen. </li>
                <li> the collision detection happens in the browser so one can easily cheat and I'm sure it is </li>
                open for a lot of bugs and hacks. </li>
                <li> Your session will get logged out after 10 minutes.</li>     
            </ul>
